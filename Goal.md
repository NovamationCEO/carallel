# Challenge Parameters:

- Create a web-app, using next.js, that lets a user login/signup
- Within the app, create a Resources area, that consists of different articles - provided by a
  backend API
- Next, implement deep linking capabilities so that when someone opens the link to an article,
  they are asked to login/signup and then directed to the said article.
- Create back-end apis, using express/node.js or nest.js (preferred), that provide authentication
  capabilities, creates a jwt token, and validate the token at login and all API calls.
- In addition, maintain a history of all the links a person went to in a db.
  Note: For this exercise, you can use an open source library or auth0 as your identity provider, and an in-
  memory db.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- Implementation completeness and correctness of the required features.
- Code quality, test, organization, and adherence to best practices.
- Backend API design, implementation, and security measures.
- Attention to detail, error handling, and validation.
- Documentation and clarity of instructions to run the applications.

### Deliverables:

- Git repository with code
- Demo of the working solution (you may useÂ Loom)
